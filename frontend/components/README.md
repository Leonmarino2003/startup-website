Here we will put our components, NOT our pages.
For example:
A page contains multiple components, sometimes even the components contain other components, such as:

- You have a page full of products.
- Product page contains Header component, product list component, footer component.
- And inside the product list component contains a product item component.
- So in this case, header, product list, and product item will all have their own folder inside the components folder.
- And the page will be located inside the "pages" folder.
